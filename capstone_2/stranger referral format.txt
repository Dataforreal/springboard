Hi Austin,

My name is [Your Name] and I found your info while I was looking for people who made the jump into tech from a non-traditional background. Your experience transitioning from healthcare to Microsoft really stood out to me.

I’m sure that transition wasn’t easy! I’d love to hear more about your journey, some of the obstacles you faced, and ask you a few questions.

I know you’re busy and your time is valuable, no need to respond in depth. If you do have a few minutes to chat, I’d be really grateful. If not, no worries! Either way, have a fantastic week.

Best,
